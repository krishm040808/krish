<h2> Intresting facts about classical cars </h2>
    <p>
    Classic cars are more than just vehicles; they are living pieces of history that tell the story of innovation, artistry, and the evolution of motoring. Did you know that the Ford Model T revolutionized manufacturing in 1908, making cars affordable for the average person, or that early cars like the Benz Patent-Motorwagen used a lever instead of a steering wheel? Iconic designs such as the gullwing doors of the 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300SL weren’t just stylish—they were a structural necessity due to its unique frame. Cars like the Rolls-Royce Phantom IV were so exclusive that only royalty and heads of state could own them, and even features we take for granted, like seatbelts, weren’t standard until the 1960s. Whether it’s the simplicity that allowed owners to repair their own vehicles or the timeless elegance that makes classics like the Ferrari 250 GTO worth millions, every classic car carries a legacy of innovation and style that continues to captivate enthusiasts around the world.</p>
